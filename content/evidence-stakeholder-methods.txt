# Stakeholder Evidence: Methods & Engagement Strategy
# Standardizing Performance Appraisals Project

## Stakeholder Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Understand how different stakeholder groups perceive the current performance appraisal inconsistency problem, including its impact on fairness, employee morale, legal compliance, and organizational effectiveness.

**Secondary Goal:** Gather stakeholder perspectives on standardizing performance appraisals as a solution, including concerns about implementation feasibility, training needs, resource requirements, and expected outcomes.

## Stakeholder Mapping

### Internal Stakeholders (Primary)
1. **Employees (Non-supervisory staff)**
   - **Interest:** Fair treatment, clear expectations, career development
   - **Power:** Low (individually), Medium (collectively through engagement/retention)
   - **Classification:** Primary stakeholders - directly affected by appraisal processes

2. **Managers/Supervisors**
   - **Interest:** Effective tools, manageable workload, team performance
   - **Power:** Medium - implement appraisals daily, influence adoption success
   - **Classification:** Primary stakeholders - responsible for execution

3. **HR Professionals**
   - **Interest:** Process efficiency, legal compliance, employee satisfaction
   - **Power:** High - design and oversee performance management systems
   - **Classification:** Primary stakeholders - own the process

4. **Senior Leadership/Executives**
   - **Interest:** Organizational performance, talent retention, legal risk mitigation
   - **Power:** High - approve resources, set strategic priorities
   - **Classification:** Primary stakeholders - decision-makers and resource allocators

### Internal Stakeholders (Secondary)
5. **Legal/Compliance Teams**
   - **Interest:** Legal risk mitigation, defensible appraisal documentation
   - **Power:** Medium - advise on compliance requirements
   - **Classification:** Secondary stakeholders - provide oversight and guidance

6. **Labor Relations/Union Representatives**
   - **Interest:** Employee protection, fair treatment, contract compliance
   - **Power:** Medium - can support or resist changes affecting members
   - **Classification:** Secondary stakeholders - advocate for employee interests

## Power/Interest Matrix

### High Power, High Interest (MANAGE CLOSELY)
- **HR Professionals:** Key partners in designing and implementing standardization
- **Senior Leadership:** Must approve initiative and allocate resources

### High Power, Low Interest (KEEP SATISFIED)
- **Legal/Compliance:** Need regular updates to ensure legal defensibility
- **Executive Leadership:** Keep informed of progress and ROI metrics

### Low Power, High Interest (KEEP INFORMED)
- **Employees:** Directly affected, need communication about fairness improvements
- **Managers/Supervisors:** Daily users, need training and support resources

### Low Power, Low Interest (MONITOR)
- **Labor Relations:** Monitor for concerns about union contract implications
- **External Auditors:** Minimal engagement unless compliance issues arise

## Data Collection Methods: Secondary Sources Approach

**Note:** This project uses secondary sources (published research, surveys, reports, online discussions) rather than primary data collection (interviews, organization-specific surveys). This approach is appropriate for Milestone 2 and allows us to gather diverse stakeholder perspectives efficiently.

## Sampling Strategy for Secondary Sources

### Stakeholder Representation Goals
**Equal Voice Across Stakeholder Groups:**
- **Employees:** 30% of evidence (from Gallup surveys, Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn discussions)
- **Managers:** 25% of evidence (from Gallup manager surveys, LinkedIn manager groups, HBR case studies)
- **HR Professionals:** 25% of evidence (from SHRM research, LinkedIn HR groups, HBR articles)
- **Senior Leadership:** 15% of evidence (from HBR executive interviews, Gallup leadership research)
- **Legal/Compliance:** 5% of evidence (from SHRM legal compliance reports, HBR risk articles)

### Data Collection Criteria
**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Published within last 5 years (2020-2025) to ensure current relevance
- Sample size of 100+ respondents (for survey-based sources)
- Clear methodology described
- Addresses performance appraisal fairness, standardization, or consistency

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Opinion pieces without data backing
- Single-organization case studies (unless representative of broader patterns)
- Sources older than 5 years (unless landmark studies)
- Non-credible or unverified sources

## Ethical Considerations

### Use of Secondary Data
**Informed Consent:** All secondary sources used (SHRM, Gallup, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, HBR) obtained informed consent from original participants through their respective data collection processes.

**Anonymity Protection:** 
- Survey data (SHRM, Gallup) aggregates responses to protect individual identities
- Glassdoor reviews are voluntarily posted anonymously
- LinkedIn discussions are public professional forums
- No individual identification in our analysis

**Proper Attribution:**
- All sources will be properly cited with full references
- Survey sample sizes and demographics will be reported
- Limitations of secondary data will be acknowledged

**Fair Representation:**
- Intentionally seeking diverse stakeholder perspectives
- Not cherry-picking only favorable perspectives
- Including concerns and resistance alongside supportive views
- Acknowledging gaps where stakeholder voices are underrepresented

### Organizational Context
**No Primary Data Collection Required:** This Milestone 2 analysis uses publicly available secondary sources, so no organizational permissions or IRB approval are needed. Future implementation phases may require primary stakeholder engagement with appropriate approvals.

- **Week 2 (Nov 18-21):** 
  - Analyze Glassdoor reviews mentioning performance review experiences
  - Review LinkedIn HR and manager group discussions on appraisal challenges
  - Synthesize stakeholder perspectives across all sources
  
- **Week 3 (Nov 21 - Milestone 2 Due):**

  - Document quality assessment and limitations
  - Finalize stakeholder evidence portfolio

### Logistical Planning
**Data Storage:**
- Save PDF copies of key research reports
- Bookmark relevant articles and discussions
- Create spreadsheet tracking source, stakeholder group, key insights

**Analysis Organization:**
- Code stakeholder quotes by group (employee, manager, HR, leadership, legal)
- Track themes: fairness concerns, implementation barriers, support factors
- Note contradictions or conflicts between stakeholder perspectives

## Data Management Plan

### Data Collection Organization
**Source Tracking Spreadsheet:**
- Column 1: Source name and URL
- Column 2: Stakeholder group(s) represented
- Column 3: Sample size/credibility indicators
- Column 4: Key quote or insight
- Column 5: Theme/topic (fairness, legal risk, implementation, ROI)
- Column 6: Supportive/Neutral/Resistant to standardization

### Analysis Preparation
**Thematic Coding:**
- **Problem Recognition:** Do stakeholders acknowledge appraisal inconsistency as a problem?
- **Impact Assessment:** How do stakeholders describe impacts (fairness, morale, legal risk)?
- **Solution Support:** Do stakeholders support standardization as a solution?
- **Implementation Concerns:** What barriers or challenges do stakeholders foresee?
- **Resource Requirements:** What do stakeholders say about training, time, and cost needs?

**Stakeholder Comparison:**
- Compare employee vs. manager perspectives on same issues
- Identify where stakeholder groups align vs. conflict
- Note power dynamics (whose concerns dominate discussions)

**MILESTONE 2 NOTE:** This methods document describes secondary source analysis appropriate for Milestone 2. No primary stakeholder interviews or organization-specific surveys are conducted at this stage. The focus is on understanding what existing research and public discussions reveal about stakeholder perspectives on performance appraisal standardization.
