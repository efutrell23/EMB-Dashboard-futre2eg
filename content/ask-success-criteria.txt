# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: [Primary Outcome] Improve Rating Consistency
- **Specific:** Measure the reduction in variance between different managers’ ratings of employees with similar performance.
- **Measurable:** Achieve ≤ 10% variance in inter-rater reliability scores (down from current baseline).
- **Achievable:** Implement rater training, standardized criteria, and calibration sessions.
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses the root issue of inconsistency.
- **Time-bound:** Within 6 months of implementing interventions.

### Criterion 2: [Secondary Outcome] Increase Perceived Fairness
- **Specific:** Assess employee perceptions of fairness in performance reviews.
- **Measurable:** Improve survey results from 65% (baseline) to at least 80% agreement on “appraisals are fair.”
- **Achievable:** Realistic through transparency, clear communication, and consistent feedback.
- **Relevant:** Higher perceived fairness drives engagement and trust.
- **Time-bound:** Measured after the next appraisal cycle (6–9 months).

### Criterion 3: [Additional Outcome] Standardize Evaluation Criteria
- **Specific:** Implement a unified competency/criteria framework across all departments.
- **Measurable:** 100% of appraisals using the same framework; reduction in missing or subjective-only categories to <5%.
- **Achievable:** Feasible with HR-led design, training, and rollout.
- **Relevant:** Reduces subjectivity and inconsistency across teams.
- **Time-bound:** Fully implemented before the next appraisal cycle.

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics

-Inter-rater reliability score (IRR): Target ≥ 0.8.
-Variance in ratings: Target ≤ 10%.
-Survey results: ≥ 80% employee agreement on fairness.
-Framework adoption: 100% compliance by next cycle.

### Qualitative Indicators

-Employees reporting clearer understanding of appraisal criteria in open-ended survey responses.
-Managers reporting greater confidence in evaluations.
-Fewer formal disputes, appeals, or grievances tied to appraisals.
-HR noting improved consistency during calibration meetings.

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)
Manager training completion, calibration meeting attendance, adoption rates of the framework.

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
Employee satisfaction scores, reduction in variance, turnover rates linked to perceived unfairness.

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
[Document current performance levels for comparison]

**Metric 1:** [Name] = [Current value]
**Metric 2:** [Name] = [Current value]
**Metric 3:** [Name] = [Current value]

### Data Collection Plan
-Statistical analysis of past appraisal scores.
Annual and post-cycle HR surveys on employee perceptions.
-Monitoring calibration sessions and HR audits.

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
10% variance reduction, 70% fairness perception.

### Target Performance Level
15–20% variance reduction, 80% fairness perception.

### Stretch Goal
≤ 5% variance, 90% fairness perception, full framework compliance.

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
Consistent, defensible ratings that align with promotion/bonus decisions.

### Employee Success Measures
Perceived fairness, transparency, and actionable feedback.

### HR/Leadership
Lower risk of legal challenges, higher trust in appraisal system.

## Risk Indicators
[What metrics would suggest the solution is failing?]

### Red Flags
-Manager resistance to training or framework adoption.
-Increase in appraisal disputes/appeals.
-Declining employee trust scores.

### Mitigation Triggers
-Additional manager training or coaching.
-Revising framework based on feedback.
-Closer HR monitoring and intervention in calibration sessions.

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
Manager training completion, framework rollout, initial calibration sessions.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
Early reduction in rating variance, improved inter-rater reliability scores.

### Long-term (6-12 months)
Sustained fairness perception, consistent ratings across all departments, adoption embedded in culture.

## Reporting Framework
[How will progress be communicated to stakeholders?]

### Dashboard Metrics
Inter-rater reliability, variance scores, training completion.

### Regular Reports
Quarterly HR reports to management and leadership.

### Milestone Reviews
Formal assessments at the end of each appraisal cycle (6–12 months).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be specific and measurable - avoid vague terms like "better" or "improved"
2. Ensure criteria are achievable given your resources and timeline
3. Include both quantitative and qualitative measures
4. Consider different stakeholder perspectives on success
5. Plan how you'll actually collect the measurement data
