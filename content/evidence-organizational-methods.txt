# Organizational Evidence: Data Collection Strategy
# Professional data repositories for testing X→Y hypothesis

## Research Question Framework

### X→Y Hypothesis
**Standardize and align performance appraisal processes and training to eliminate inconsistency (X) SO THAT the organization reduces legal exposure and strengthens fairness and transparency in talent decisions (Y)**

### Questions to Answer with Data
1. What is the average/median/trend for variables related to X or Y?
2. How does my context/industry/region compare to others?
3. What patterns exist over time or across different groups?

## Three-Source Strategy

### Strategic Approach
- **Source 1 (OPM FEVS):** Testing X→Y relationship with logic model capability
- **Source 2 (EEOC Statistics):** Measuring legal outcomes (Y variable)
- **Source 3 (BLS NCS):** Describing HR practices (X variable) and benchmarking

### Data Collection Timeline
- **Collection Period:** 1997-2023 (longitudinal data available)
- **Data Sources Accessed:** 3 professional government repositories
- **Data Quality Assessment:** HIGH - Government databases with validated, standardized measurement
