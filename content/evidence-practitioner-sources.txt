- **Source:** Business Source Complete - "How Calibration Committees Can Mitigate Performance Evaluation Bias: An Analysis of Implicit Incentives" (Accounting Review, 2020)

### Problem Context
- **Problem Description:** Performance evaluation bias with two main issues: (1) Supervisors strategically inflating subordinates' ratings to make themselves look better, and (2) Supervisors providing compressed ratings due to lack of skills in giving negative feedback
- **Problem Severity:** High - causing incorrect personnel decisions, inadequate resource allocation, unjustified increased personnel costs, and misrepresentation of subordinate development needs
- **Stakeholders Affected:** Supervisors, subordinates, senior management, HR department, firm profitability
- **Triggering Events:** Recognition that subjective performance evaluations were being distorted, leading to poor decision-making and resource misallocation

### Solution Approach
- **Strategy Chosen:** Implemented calibration committee system with implicit incentives to change supervisor evaluation behavior
- **Implementation Process:** 
  1. Created committees of higher-level managers, direct supervisors, and peers
  2. Established annual calibration sessions where supervisors present each subordinate
  3. Committee reviews and adjusts initial ratings based on multiple information sources
  4. Sequential evaluation process (subordinates first, then supervisors)
  5. Committee incorporates supervisor evaluation behavior into supervisor's own performance outcomes
- **Resources Invested:** Higher-level management time for committee sessions, structured evaluation process documentation, committee meeting organization
- **Timeline:** Annual process implemented over 3-year study period

### Results and Outcomes
- **Measurable Results:** 
  - Supervisors with downgraded ratings received decreased performance ratings themselves (p < 0.01)
  - Supervisors showing rating discrimination had 28% higher promotion probability
  - Supervisors caught in opportunistic behavior were 50% less likely to repeat it the following year
  - Economic impact: 13% increase in probability of receiving low ratings for downgrades, 37% for selective presentation
- **Qualitative Improvements:** Better evaluation accuracy, improved supervisor accountability, enhanced performance differentiation among subordinates
- **Stakeholder Reactions:** Supervisors learned to avoid opportunistic behavior and invest in evaluation skills; management gained better performance information

## CASE STUDY #3: Evaluator Perspective and Negativity Bias in Performance Evaluation

**Organization:** Management Accounting Research experimental study with 120 MBA participants
**Industry:** Cross-industry experimental research (retail scenario used for simulation)
**Problem Context:** 
- Performance evaluation inconsistency due to evaluator perspective differences
- Negativity bias where negative performance outcomes receive disproportionate weight vs. equivalent positive outcomes
- Conflicts arising between supervisors and managers when performance evaluations differ based on evaluator role
- Need to understand when rating differences are most likely to occur and create potential conflict

**Solution Approach:**
- Experimental design with 3 evaluator perspectives: supervisor, mixed performer, positive performer
- Used balanced scorecard with 16 measures (8 strategically linked, 8 non-strategically linked)
- Tested performance evaluation differences across two scenarios:
  * Mixed manager performing below target on less important measures
  * Mixed manager performing below target on more important measures
- Controlled for linear equivalence between managers' overall performance
- Applied negativity bias theory to predict evaluation patterns

**Results:**
- **Universal Negativity Bias:** All three evaluator types (supervisors, mixed managers, positive managers) exhibited negativity bias, weighting negative outcomes more heavily than equivalent positive outcomes
- **Conditional Evaluation Differences:** Differences between supervisor and manager evaluations depended on which measures had negative outcomes:
  * When negative outcomes on less important measures: supervisors and mixed managers had similar evaluations, positive managers were more negative
  * When negative outcomes on more important measures: supervisors and positive managers had similar evaluations, mixed managers were less negative
- **Self-Enhancement Constraints:** Managers' ability to enhance their self-evaluations was limited by the negativity bias - they couldn't completely eliminate bias even when motivated to do so
- **Peer vs. Self Evaluation Differences:** Across both conditions, mixed managers consistently rated themselves less negatively than positive managers rated them

**Lessons Learned:**
- Evaluation perspective matters most when negative performance involves strategically important measures
- Training should address negativity bias across all evaluator roles, not just supervisors
- Conflicts are predictable based on performance patterns and measure importance
- Communication between supervisors and managers becomes critical when evaluation differences are expected
- Self-evaluations don't eliminate bias but can moderate it in specific contexts
- Organizations should anticipate and manage evaluation conflicts proactively rather than reactively

## CASE STUDY #4: Algorithmic vs. Human Performance Evaluation - Trust and Objectivity

**Organization:** Journal of Information Systems experimental study with 120 Prolific Academic participants
**Industry:** Technology/AI implementation across organizations (cross-industry applicability)
**Problem Context:** 
- Growing adoption of algorithmic performance evaluation systems but employee resistance (algorithm aversion)
- Existing human evaluation biases leading to unfair performance ratings and reduced employee trust
- Need to understand when employees will accept algorithmic evaluation over human supervisor evaluation
- Conflict between efficiency benefits of algorithms vs. employee preference for human judgment
- High turnover costs ($600 billion annually in US) partly driven by biased performance evaluations

**Solution Approach:**
- Experimental comparison of algorithmic vs. human supervisor performance evaluation
- Tested employee reactions under different bias conditions (positive vs. negative evaluation bias)
- Measured perceived trustworthiness and objectivity across conditions
- Used escalation bias manipulation (supervisor's previous promotion recommendations)
- Examined mediating role of perceived objectivity in evaluation acceptance

**Results:**
- **Conditional Algorithm Acceptance:** When negative evaluation bias existed, employees perceived algorithmic evaluation as more trustworthy than human evaluation (algorithm appreciation)
- **Bias-Dependent Switching:** When positive evaluation bias existed, employees preferred human evaluation over algorithmic evaluation (algorithm aversion)
- **Objectivity as Key Mediator:** Perceived objectivity of algorithms significantly mediated trustworthiness when employees faced negative bias (β = -1.39, 95% CI = [-2.09, -0.77])
- **Fairness Improvements:** In negative bias conditions, algorithmic evaluation scored higher on both distributive fairness (5.12 vs. 2.98) and procedural fairness (4.72 vs. 2.90)
- **Reduced Turnover Intent:** Employees facing negative bias were less likely to quit when evaluated by algorithms vs. humans

**Lessons Learned:**
- Algorithm adoption succeeds when it addresses existing human bias problems rather than replacing unbiased human judgment
- Employee acceptance of technology depends on perceived threat from current system, not just technology superiority
- Objectivity perception is crucial for algorithm acceptance - employees must believe algorithms eliminate human bias
- Organizations should implement algorithmic evaluation in contexts where human bias is most problematic
- Training should emphasize algorithm objectivity and bias reduction rather than just efficiency gains
- Combined human-algorithm approaches may improve both objectivity and acceptance

## CASE STUDY #5: Outcome Bias in Team Performance Evaluation - Field Evidence

**Organization:** Australian Football League (AFL) professional team (field study from The Accounting Review)
**Industry:** Professional Sports (with broader organizational applications)
**Problem Context:** 
- Supervisors' performance evaluations biased by random positive/negative outcomes rather than actual performance
- Outcome bias violating informativeness principle - coaches overweighting game results vs. player behavior
- Personnel decisions (team selection, playing time) unfairly influenced by narrow wins/losses
- Information gathering reduced after negative outcomes, limiting evaluation accuracy
- High-performing team members disproportionately affected by outcome bias
- Incomplete performance measures exacerbating supervisory bias in complex evaluation tasks

**Solution Approach:**
- Regression discontinuity design comparing coach evaluations after narrow wins vs. narrow losses
- Analyzed 1,378 player-game observations across 68 games over 3 seasons
- Decomposed overall ratings into 4 subratings: effort, offense, defense, stoppages
- Measured information gathering through video footage review duration and clips analyzed
- Examined differential effects on high vs. low performers
- Tested impact of objective performance measure completeness on bias severity

**Results:**
- **Significant Outcome Bias:** Narrow losses caused 0.65-0.86 point decrease in player ratings (p < 0.05)
- **Personnel Impact:** Narrow losses tripled likelihood of player being dropped from lineup (11% vs 4%)
- **Playing Time Reduction:** 8.26 minute average decrease in playing time after narrow losses
- **Incomplete Measures More Biased:** Effort and defense ratings (with incomplete objective measures) showed significant bias; offense and stoppages (with complete measures) showed no bias
- **Reduced Information Gathering:** Coaches reviewed ~192 seconds less video footage after losses (half standard deviation reduction)
- **High Performer Vulnerability:** Outcome bias concentrated on high-performing players (-0.97 rating impact, p < 0.01); no significant bias for low performers
- **Continuous Performance:** No observable differences in actual player performance across narrow wins/losses

**Lessons Learned:**
- Outcome bias is most severe when objective performance measures are incomplete, requiring more subjective interpretation
- High-performing employees are disproportionately vulnerable to unfair evaluation bias
- Negative outcomes trigger reduced information gathering, creating self-reinforcing bias cycles
- Forced distribution systems cannot correct outcome bias since it affects some but not all evaluations uniformly
- Organizations with salient binary outcomes (win/loss, deal/no deal, grant/no grant) face heightened bias risk
- Training supervisors on cognitive reconstruction processes could help mitigate selective recall and information integration biases
- Structured evaluation protocols and enhanced objective measurement systems can reduce bias susceptibility
