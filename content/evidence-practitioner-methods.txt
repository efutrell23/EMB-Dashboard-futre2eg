# Practitioner Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering expert insights and professional experience

## Practitioner Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Gather insights from HR professionals and managers on the real-world causes and impacts of performance appraisal rating inconsistency, validating our scientific evidence findings of 35-40% variance.

### Source Documentation
- **Keep Track Of:** Where I found each case study and when
- **Check Credibility:** Is this from a reliable source? How recent is it?
- **Note Source Type:** Company's own story vs. outside journalist vs. business school case study

## Research Strategy

### Case Study Search Plan
**Phase 1: Find Good Articles & Cases (Weeks 1-2)**
- Start with HBR and SHRM websites
- Search for company success stories online
- Look for recent articles on performance management improvements
- Goal: Find 8-12 good examples to study

**Phase 2: Look at Company Stories (Weeks 2-3)**
- Check out company websites and HR blogs
- Find conference presentations online
- Read news articles about companies that improved their performance reviews
- Goal: Document 5-8 real transformation stories

**Phase 3: Put It All Together (Week 4)**
- Organize what I learned from each case study
- Look for patterns - what worked across different companies?
- Figure out what lessons I can actually use
- Summarize the key insights for my project

### What Makes a Good Case Study for My Research
**I'll Include Cases That:**
- Actually talk about performance review consistency or fairness problems
- Share specific details about what they tried and what happened
- Give enough information that I can understand how they did it
- Come from reliable sources (known companies, established business publications)
- Are recent (last 10 years, preferably last 5)

**I'll Skip Cases That:**
- Are too vague about what they actually did
- Don't share any results or outcomes
- Sound more like theory than real implementation
- Come from questionable sources or seem like marketing

## My Research Approach

### Using Published Information Responsibly
- **What I'm Doing:** Looking at case studies and company stories that are already published online to learn from their experiences
- **How I'll Use It:** I'll give credit to sources and companies when I reference their stories in my project
- **Being Honest:** I'll present what companies actually found, not just the parts that support my ideas
- **Staying Realistic:** I'll note when case studies might not apply to my situation or have limitations

## Expected Challenges

### Case Study Availability
**Challenge:** Limited published case studies specifically focused on performance appraisal consistency
**Mitigation:** Expand search to include broader performance management improvement cases that address consistency as a component

### Information Depth
**Challenge:** Some case studies may lack enough detail about how they actually did it
**My Plan:** Look for multiple sources about the same company; focus on cases that share specific numbers and results

### Source Credibility
**Challenge:** Hard to tell the difference between real case studies and marketing fluff
**My Plan:** Stick to well-known business publications and look for cases with actual numbers and results

### Relevance to Context
**Challenge:** Cases may be from very different types of companies than what I'm dealing with
**My Plan:** Look at multiple cases to find common themes that work across different situations; note which context factors matter most

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Sources
**If I can't find enough perfect case studies:**
- Look at broader performance management improvement stories that mention consistency
- Check out case studies about reducing bias in hiring (similar challenges)
- Look at companies that won SHRM awards for HR excellence

### Modified Scope
**If the "perfect match" cases don't exist:**
- Include stories about related problems (manager bias, rating inflation, unfair reviews)
- Look at successful change management cases that had measurable results
- Focus on finding common patterns in what works, even across different types of problems

### Minimum Viable Evidence
**What I absolutely need:**
- At least 5 solid case studies with real results
- Examples from different types of companies/industries
- Clear evidence that their solutions actually worked
- Enough detail that I can understand what they did and consider trying it

---
MY RESEARCH REMINDERS:
1. Start with the most reliable sources (HBR, SHRM, well-known companies)
2. Use simple search terms that real people would use
3. Be picky about which case studies I include - quality over quantity
4. Use my template to organize each case so I can easily compare them
5. Focus on learning practical lessons I can actually use
6. Look for patterns across multiple cases to find what really works
7. Don't get fooled by marketing disguised as case studies
