## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

### High Influence, High Interest (Manage Closely)
-Senior Management – Engage with regular updates, executive summaries, and data-driven insights showing how consistency improves fairness and supports strategic goals.

Approach: Regular meetings, progress reports, and workshops to co-create the solution.

### High Influence, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)

Approach: Provide compliance documentation and highlight fairness improvements if requested.

### Low Influence, High Interest (Keep Informed)
-Employees/Staff – Communicate openly about how the solution ensures fairer reviews and supports career growth.
-Community/Society – Share outcomes (e.g., fairness initiatives, employee engagement improvements) that strengthen employer brand.
Approach: Employee town halls, surveys, intranet updates; public communications through company website, social channels, or CSR reports.

### Low Influence, Low Interest (Monitor)
-Suppliers/Partners – Little direct impact, but keep an eye on potential effects on collaboration and communication.
